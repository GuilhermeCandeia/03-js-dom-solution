# JS DOM Counter

<br>

## Context

You have learned the basics of DOM manipulation. One of the concepts that were presented during the lectures was how to **add event listeners** to DOM elements and how to **access and change the content of DOM elements**.
In this exercise, you will have a chance to check your understanding of it.

<br>

## Getting Started

All your work should be done in the `index.js` file.

Take a look at the `index.html` file. You will see some markup already present: the 2 buttons and a paragraph with the counter value.

<br>

## Your code and submission

To check on your progress and if you are passing the tests, you can click on the `RUN TESTS` button.

In addition to this, you can reference the tests by opening the `index.test.js` file.

**_Hint_**: You may want to reference the test output (in the `Run Output` panel) since there might be some edge cases stated in the tests, that might not be too obvious from instructions.

To submit the current challenge when done, you have to click on the `SUBMIT` button, in the upper right corner.

<br>

### Final Submission

The final submission of the assessment is done in the REVIEW panel. There you will be prompted to check your code once again and make a final submission. You can't do any re-submission after this step is done.

<br>

## Tasks & Objectives

### 1. Add an event listener to enable incrementing the counter

The _increment_ button should increment the counter value by 1 on each click and stop incrementing when the counter value reaches 10.

To implement this you should:

- Get the DOM element with the corresponding `id`.
- Add an event listener that increments the counter value on each click, up to 10.

<br>

### 2. Add an event listener to enable decrementing the counter

The _decrement_ button should decrement the counter value by 1 and stop decrementing when the counter value reaches 0.

To implement this you should:

- Get the DOM element with the corresponding `id`.
- Add an event listener that decrements the counter value on each click, until 0.

Good luck!
